In this project,I investigated the relationship between social media use and mental health.

I gathered data using a survey ([[redacted link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXGqE6TCUntdD8vV00v_NLuZejYtLqkEDe6toleSnddBKoYA/viewform)]) and analyzed it to see if there were any connections between people's social media habits and their mental well-being.


**Here is what I did:**

**Cleaning and preparing the data**: This involved handling missing values, renaming columns, and creating scores for psychological indicators like ADHD, Anxiety, Self-esteem, and Depression. I then explored the data using visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to understand the relationships between age, gender, time spent on social media, and mental health.
**Grouping people**: Using a clustering algorithm, I divided the survey respondents into three groups based on their social media use and mental health characteristics.
**Delved deeper into the relationships**: I used statistical methods to identify correlations between different factors, examining how strongly they were linked.
**Built a prediction model**: I created a model to see if I could predict whether someone might need counseling based on their social media habits and mental health scores.


**My findings:**

My analysis suggested a possible link between social media use and mental health.
I identified three distinct groups of people based on their mental health.
Daily social media use and gender appeared to influence which group people belonged to.
My prediction model showed promising accuracy in identifying individuals who might benefit from counseling.


In short, the project provides some initial clues about how social media affects mental health. More research is needed to dig deeper.
